* Hello. my name is Cam.
- I am interested in (among other things) algorithmic analysis, abstract algebra, and functional programming.
- I primarily use Lisp, and Haskell, and I am learning Rust.
- More about me can be found [[https://vibe-876.github.io/][here]] (nothing there for now, because I'm redoing it).
